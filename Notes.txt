Nice work. Your comments on the scalability are correct. For this type
of problems strong scalability cannot be reached becouse as the number
of processes grows the work done by each processor decreases but
communications do not scale accordingly.

Weak scalability is not reached becouse the number of iterations depend on the condition number that scales as h^-2, being h the element size, so it scales approximately as N, being N the number of unknwowns of the problem.

To have weak scalability we need to have a number of iteration constrant with h, and this can be obteined only with a good preconditioner, which, however, must itself be parallel!
